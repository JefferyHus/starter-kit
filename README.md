# Starter Kit

This repository is to help whoever wants to start programming and have no idea from where to start.

## Path

Before you ever start categorising yourself as a backend, frontend or whatever developer section you like, there are some essential things to learn first. The thing many are missing is the fact that learning a language and start coding is really easy but there are factors that filters or differs between engineers, these factors are:

- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Design Patterns
- System Design

My advice is to start these as your first step towards a great career, I am not mentioning that just because big corps are interviewing you abou these topics, bu the fact that you have to design your solutions based on these everytime you wish to create something.

Some courses out there are always using a language to explain things in a practical thing, you may do same by learning a language like C, Python or Java. Just know that you can still practice what you learned in a logical way instead of using a programming language by just using your native language.

**Example**
```
if a _car_ is from Jaguare then
  call john to fix it
else
  call stephanie to fix it
```

Once you feel ready, that's when you will pick your side to be either in the backend or frontend of things, some people just pick a side directly without further thinking which might be bad in the future where you will find yourself bored and may not even continue that path and will have to do a turn-back and start looking for your best fit.

The method that I would suggest is to do a full side project that touches every part of the workflow of an application, then only you will see what your brain leans towards best.
